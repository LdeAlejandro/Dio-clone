# DIO Clone - React Project

This project is a React-based recreation of the [DIO Clone Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/fvjQQNtqaUdpuNixvCZVav/DIO-CLONE?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=iUrtmwBhrumeZ1XR-0) using `styled-components` for styling.

## Project Structure and Routing

The app is structured with the following main routes:

- **`/`**: Renders the `<Home />` component, the default landing page.
- **`/login`**: Renders the `<Login />` component for user authentication.
- **`/feed`**: Renders the `<Feed />` component, displaying user feed content.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Styled Components**: For applying CSS-in-JS styling, making it easier to create component-based styles.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation and routing across the application.

## Layout

The layout design is based on a Figma file. You can view the original design here:

## Project Overview

This project aims to replicate the DIO platform layout and functionality using React. It provides:
- A clean user interface for the home, login, and feed pages.
- Responsive components styled with `styled-components` to match the Figma design.
